This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project as part of the IBM Applied Data Science with R course. 

The project involved using R to build a machine learning model to predict bike-sharing demand, and developing a Shiny application to visualize the results. The repository includes the R scripts for the machine learning model and Shiny application, data files, and a report documenting the project methodology and findings. The Shiny application allows users to interactively explore the model predictions and gain insights into bike-sharing demand patterns.
